Contains Python interfaces to various lab instruments that I use.
Will be added and extended according to my own needs. If they help
you, so much the better. 

Wherever possible, modules implement the context manager protocol,
so that they can be used like this:

from Frobnitz3000 import *
with Frobnitz300 as frobnitz:
    data = frobnitz.measure_stuff()
    
If it's not feasible to use the context manager protocol, you can
also initialize and shut down the instruments like this:

frobnitz.open(parameters)
data = frobnitz.measure_stuff()
frobnitz.close()
